(Short-legged furniture, like beds or couches, are generally counted using 台.) But, 脚 can count long-legged non-furniture items as well: wine glasses, horseshoes, and… legs. In Japanese, a three-legged race is 二人三脚—literally, \"two people three legs.\"\nCounts: chairs, tables, desks, wine glasses, horseshoes, legs, etc.\n"
