  "more": "-- <! Inline 52: a cherry blossom with many layers of petals>\nThis counter used to count things that overlapped (doubled, tripled, etc.), but that usage has become archaic, and it is currently just used idiomatically. Some common examples of this include: 二重まぶた (ふたえまぶた) \"double eyelids,\" 八重桜 (やえざくら) \"double cherry blossoms,\" and 幾重にも (いくえにも) \"repeatedly, over and over.\"\nThis is a particularly beautiful traditional expression. The 八重 (eight layers) of 八重桜 invokes a magnificent cherry tree overflowing with blossoms, each with many layers of petals.\nThese expressions usually use one, two, or eight, and they're all read with the wago readings.\nCounts: eyelid layers, cherry blossom petal layers, kimono layers\n"
