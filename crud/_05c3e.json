Fish that are fishing targets or that have been caught and are for sale at the market are counted by fishermen and fish store employees with this counter. Fish for sale at pet stores are also counted this way, but usually by the seller, not the buyer. For other fish and crustaceans, it's more common to count them with 匹 (ひき).\nCounts: fish, shrimp, prawns, crabs (for eating), crayfish, lobsters, etc.\n# https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/japanese-counter-hiki/"
