The first two cans can be counted with either wago or kango numbers. \"One can\" is １缶, read as either いっかん or ひとかん. \"Two cans\" is ２缶, read as either にかん or ふたかん. From three cans and up you use the kango counting method. When a can is empty—or when it's a garbage can—you'll generally want to use the counter 個 instead of 缶.\nCounts: soda cans, beer cans, tuna cans, bean cans, milk cans, spray cans, paint cans, tea leaves in tins, etc.\n"
