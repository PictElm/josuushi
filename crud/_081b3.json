It's specifically the counter of choice for bowls of rice—bowls of other kinds of food can also be counted with 杯 (はい), but 膳 is more polite. Similarly, counting chopsticks with 膳 is the \"correct,\" polite way to do it.\nCounts: chopsticks (as utensils), bowls of rice, bowls of meat, wood that's not yet processed into lumber, etc.\n"
