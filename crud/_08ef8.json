  "more": "-- As a word, 軸 means \"axis\" or \"axle.\" As a counter, it's used for counting scrolls, rolls, and yarn balls—in other words, things that unwind from a central axis. 軸 can also be used to count the favored horse to win a horse race, probably because horses run in a loop around a central axis. When counting with 軸, one and two are read with wago and the rest with kango.\nCounts: scrolls, rolled sheets, hanging scrolls, yarn rolls, axis, the favorite horse\n"
