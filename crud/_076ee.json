Use it to count seams, sutures, and stitches (縫い目/ぬいめ), mesh (網目/あみめ), knitting stitches (編み目/あみめ), squares on manuscript paper (升目/ますめ), and the pips on dice (サイコロの目/さいころのめ). 一目 also has an idiomatic usage of \"one glance\" or \"one look.\" The wago readings are used for one and two, and are usually the only two used.\n目 can be used as an ordinal number suffix after the general counter 〜つ. For example, 一つ目 is \"the first one,\" 二つ目 is \"the second one,\" and so on.\nCounts: seams, sutures, stitches, mesh, manuscript squares, notebook squares, pips, looks, glances, etc.\n"
