  "more": "The verb 装う has two possible readings and meanings. The first is よそう, which means \"to serve something into a place or dish.\" The second is よそおう, which means \"to dress oneself.\" The counter 装い is used to count both servings (よそい) and sets of clothes, costumes, or furniture (よそおい). It's much more commonly used to count servings of food (よそい), however, so it's really the only one most people need to be familiar with.\nThe wago readings are used for one and two, and the rest are quite rare. It's also normal to see this written in hiragana, without kanji.\nCounts: ladles of miso soup, scoops of a meal, servings of rice, etc.\n"
