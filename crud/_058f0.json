  "more": "The word 声 means \"voice.\" As a counter, 声 is used to count the number of times you \"have a word with someone,\" as well as the number of times someone or something cries or calls out. This counter uses the wago counting scheme for one and two, but three and above are rare, so focus on ひとこえ and ふたこえ. 声 is part of an idiom worth learning too: もう一声, which means \"a little more of a discount.\" It's handy when you want to barter!\n声 (せい) is also used to count the number of sounds, noises, or words that come out of something—usually a mouth. The せい version is counted with kango.\nCounts: utterances, having a word with someone, crying out, calling out, sounds, noises, words, etc.\n"
