Inline 7: a spoon>\n匙 means \"spoon,\" and the counter version is used to count the amount a spoon will hold. 大匙 (おおさじ)—literally \"big spoon\"—is a tablespoon. 小匙 (こさじ)—\"little spoon\"—is a teaspoon. Be careful, though: like \"cups\" (合), the amount a spoon can hold may vary from county to country. Use wago for counting one and two, either wago or kango for three, and kango for four and above.\n(Also, be aware that although 匙 is still in use, the counter 杯 (はい) is more commonly used for spoonfuls these days.)\nCounts: spoonfuls\n"
