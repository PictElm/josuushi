Depending on what you use it for, 度 can be read as either ど or たび. The numbering system can either be wago or kango, depending on the number and what you're counting: it's kango for ど and wago for たび, but たび is only used to count up to the number three in modern Japanese.\nCounts: the number of times something happens, chances, opportunities, experiences, series of actions, divided actions, degrees, temperature, etc.\n"
