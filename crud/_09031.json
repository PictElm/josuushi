Most of the time, you'll want to add the suffix 間 (かん) which changes \"week\" to \"for __ weeks.\" For example, ２週間 would mean \"for two weeks,\" and ５週間 would mean \"for five weeks.\"\nIf you add the ordinal number suffix 目 to 週 it identifies which week you're talking about. ３週目 means \"the third week,\" and １週目 means \"the first week.\" Alternatively, you could add the ordinal number prefix 第 (だい). 第１週 would mean \"the first week\" as well.\nCounts: weeks\n"
