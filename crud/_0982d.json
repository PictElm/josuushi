  "more": "-- As we mentioned in the 匹 section, 頭 is generally used for large-sized animals. If you can't pick the animal up, chances are you could count it with 頭. That being said, there are some exceptions where 頭 is used for smaller animals, and 匹 gets used for bigger ones (like Godzilla). For more details and information on exceptions, read our article on the 頭 counter.\nCounts: cows, horses, livestock, elephants, gorillas, whales, camels, tigers, \"professional\" animals, insects on display, animals for sale, etc.\n# https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/japanese-counter-tou/"
