  "more": "# https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/japanese-counter-mai/  皿 means \"dish\" or \"plate,\" referring to dishes or plates of food. For empty plates, you can still use 皿, but the counter 枚 will be more common for this. If you want to count individual pieces of food on the plate, you'll want to use 品 (しな). You can use 皿 to count laboratory dishes as well (like the ones that grow bacteria). For one and two plates, use the wago reading (ひとさら、ふたさら). Three can be either (みさら or さんさら). From four on up, just use kango.\nCounts: plates, dishes, lab dishes, food on a plate/dish, one serving of soba (usually cold), etc.\n"
