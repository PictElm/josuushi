  "more": "-- <! Inline 4: a rice cooker>\nAs a unit of measurement, 合 is equal to about 0.18 liters, or about 1/10th of a 升 (しょう), and you can use it to count cups of rice. When a rice cooker or recipe calls for \"a cup of rice,\" it might be asking for one of these instead of a standard \"cup.\" 合 is also used for counting the stages of a mountain trail: the first stage, or first 1/10th of the path, would be １合. You can count other things using 合, but these are the most common.\nCounts: 0.18 liter \"cups\" of rice, 1/10th stages of a hiking trail\n"
