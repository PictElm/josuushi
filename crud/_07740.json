This is because the word 着く means \"to arrive.\" First place is the first to arrive, right? Anyways, as a regular counter, it's just about clothes.\nCounts: clothes or garments such as overcoats, coats, cloaks, kimono, yukata, suits, raincoats, dresses, skirts, jackets, swimsuits, costumes, robes, suits of armor, etc. It's also the ordinal number suffix for first, second, third, etc., place in a race.\n"
