  "more": "-- <! Inline 51: a window frame>\nThe counter 枠 counts frames, borders or boxes on paper, and job positions. It can also be used to count gates in horse racing (which originally grew from the job position meaning). The wago readings are used for one and two, and the rest are kango. If you're counting horse gates, however, the kango readings are used for all of them.\nCounts: frames, window frames, boxes on paper, borders on paper, horse racing gates, job positions, positions, time slots, etc.\n"
