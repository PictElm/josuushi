Some people in certain regions count futon mattresses with 流れ as well, though it's usually when they're lined up together in a room (and look like 川). The wago readings are used for one, two, and three, and the rest aren't used very often, if at all.\nCounts: flags, banners, streamers, floats, battle flags, written lines, rivers, streams, futon mattresses\n"
