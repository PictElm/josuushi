If you see 四品目はラーメン and it means \"the fourth dish is ramen,\" it's よんしなめ. However, if it means \"ramen with four ingredients,\" it's よんひんもく. The reading is entirely dependent on the context, so try to pay close attention when using these two counters.\nCounts: items, varieties of dishes, numbers of ingredients, types of products, meals, exhibits, etc.\n"
