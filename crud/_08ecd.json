  "more": "-- <! Inline 1: two little plastic green army men>\nThe kanji 軍 refers to army troops. As a counter, 軍 used to count them too, though in recent years it has expanded to include other similar kinds of groups. For example, 軍 is used as an ordinal number suffix to refer to levels in organized sports: a varsity team would be 一軍, while a junior varsity or a \"farm\" team would be 二軍. It makes sense if you think about it, since sports teams have a lot of similarities to military troops.\nCounts: army groups, groups of troops, sports team levels, baseball team levels, etc.\n"
