  "more": "-- The kanji 人 means \"person.\" The counter 人 follows suit by counting numbers of people. Beyond people, it can also count things we treat like people, such as fairies, elves, and even your pets, if you treat them like family. It goes much deeper than that, and you can learn more in the article we wrote about the 人 counter.\nIt's also important to note that the first two people (一人、二人) get counted using the wago counting method. Three people and up (三人) are just counted in kango.\nCounts: humans, people, angels, mermaids, Doraemon, humanoids, pets that are like family, etc.\n# https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/japanese-counter-nin/"
