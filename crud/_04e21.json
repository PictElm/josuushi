  "more": "<! Inline 48: a train car>\nThis kanji originally meant \"pairs,\" so it's used to count pairs of clothes, like pairs of socks, for example. Later, it began to be used to count things with pairs of wheels on both sides (台/だい). It began with horse-pulled carriages, carts, and wagons. These days it's mostly used to count train cars.\nIt can also be used with the ordinal number suffix 目 to count specific cars on a train. For example, 一両目 is the first car, 二両目 is the second car, and so on.\n両 also used to be a currency unit back in the Edo period. Have you seen a lucky cat holding a big coin? Many of the coins say 千万両 or 百万両, and that is this 両 currency. One 両 is valued at ¥40,000, which is about 00, so 千万両 (ten million ryo) would be four billion dollars!\nCounts: train cars, railroad cars, horse carriages, horse carts, horse wagons, old units of money, etc.\n"
