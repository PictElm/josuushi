  "more": "-- This kanji primarily means \"mouth,\" but it also means \"to swing down a sword and cut something open.\" Because of that, it's used to count swords and knives. The counters 振り (じふり) and 口 (くち) can also be used to count them. The wago readings are used for one and two, three can be either, and the rest are kango.\nCounts: swords, katana, knives, kitchen knives, etc.\n"
