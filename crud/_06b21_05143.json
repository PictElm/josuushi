Inline 10: an anime girl>\nThis counter counts dimensions: 2D, 3D, 4D, etc. In this context, you'll use the kango counting scheme. 次元 can also be used to count different \"levels\" of a person, as in \"I'm an entire level above you.\" When used this way, employ the wago readings for one and two, kango for the rest.\nCounts: dimensions, levels of a person\n"
