It's also used to count things that resemble mountains when piled up, like fruits and vegetables, or packages of items in a grocery store.\nThere are two idiomatic usages for this counter that use 一山 (ひとやま), or \"one mountain.\" The first can be written as either 山当てる (ひとやまあてる) or 一山儲ける (ひとやまもうける), and means \"to make a killing\" (literally, to win a mountain). The second is 一山越える (ひとやまこえる), which means \"to get over a hard or difficult period\" (literally, to climb over a mountain).\nThe wago readings are used for one and two, and the rest are kango.\nCounts: mountains, piles, mounds, etc.\n"
