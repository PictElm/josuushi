  "more": "-- The counter 冊 is used to count books. From the kanji, you can see it looks just like a book from the side. Don't confuse this with the counter 本 which, ironically, is not used to count books (even though the word 本 means \"book\"). This is a pretty straightforward counter, but you can still learn more by reading the in-depth article we wrote about it.\nCounts: books, book collections, albums, notebooks, memo pads, musical scores, catalogs, magazines, dictionaries, publications, documents, booklets, etc.\n# https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/japanese-counter-satsu/"
