To count branches of a single bank, use 店 (てん) or 店舗 (てんぽ) instead.\n行 also counts other things. For example, 一行 used to refer to a group of twenty soldiers, and while this usage isn't as common as it used to be, you'll still hear it used when counting groups or parties of people. 観光客一行 (かんこうきゃくいっこう), for example, is used to count parties of tourists.\nSimilarly, you may see hotels and ryokan with welcome signs that make use of 行 to indicate groups of people—something like トーフグ御一行様 (とーふぐごいっこうさま): \"The Tofugu Group.\"\nCounts: banks, groups of people, parties of people\n"
