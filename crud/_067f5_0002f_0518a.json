The same goes for the strips of fish, on display at restaurants, that haven't yet been sliced into bite-sized pieces.\nYoung people have started using 柵 to count blocks of seats in stadiums and concert halls. In this context, 柵 usually indicates the seats closest to the stage or field where, back in the day, there was once a fence or divider. (柵 means \"fence.\")\nWhile both the kanji 柵 or 冊 can be used, 柵 is technically more correct. Writing さく in hiragana is common too—just make sure to use the wago counting method for one and two and kango for three or more.\nCounts: strips or blocks of fish, rows of a stadium, rows of a concert hall, rows of an auditorium, etc.\n"
