  "more": "-- Have you ever wondered, \"What does 'katamari' from Katamari Damacy mean?\" You've come to the right place! \"Katamari\" means \"ball,\" \"lump,\" or \"mass,\" which is exactly what the Prince is rolling up. The kanji 塊 means a lump, ball, or mass of something, and the counter version is used to count those things. Use the wago counting method for one and two lumps, then kango for any above that. (And, since you're curious, \"damacy\" means \"soul\" or \"spirit.\")\nCounts: balls, masses, lumps or chunks of meat, clouds, people, dirt, cheese, fish, etc.\n"
