# TODO

* home page: usage examples?
* (css) still bad on eg. phone
* (css) font (find one with accurate enough kanji)
* function to do plural or singular so only one is present in the tags (probably more natural to have plural in the tags?)
* about less common or such readings (eg. いっぴ, みったり, よったり, ...)
* niti: distinguish tuitati (1st) and itiniti (1 day) (other such exception to account for?)
* syuukan: is there a syuu (as in eg. 1st week?)
* about suffix (eg. -kan, -me)
* handle counters with multiple kanji/readings
* [more counters, starting with eg.:]
  - [zikan] - same as zi..
  - [ko] & tu
